# Weaponized Creeper Wars
## Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.3/1.20.4 Datapack

Here is the datapack that my Minecraft mini-game server at wcw.mcstacker.net is using. I'm sharing it here for others to learn from. If you are new to datapacks and mcfunctions you might learn how easily vanilla mini-games can be created. You'll find lots of helpful comments in the code which explain a bit about what is going on.

Some of the commands used in this datapack were created on my Minecraft Command Generator at https://mcstacker.net .

I have a website that explains the game here https://wcw.mcstacker.net

#### Getting Started
1. Setup a Vanilla Server with a Void world
2. Put the datapack in the datapacks folder
3. Run the `/reload` command (You need to be the operator)
4. Run `/function wc:setup` once only to setup the game for this world.
